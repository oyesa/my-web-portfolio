      <h4>About Me</h4>
      <p>I have a background in social sciences. I graduated from the University of Nairobi in 2016 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in sociology and geography. I have worked in various industries on different capacities. From being a map technician with Ramani Geosystems Limited, to working with Timken Company as an administrator, and then working with Japan International Corporation Agency also as an administrator. My interest in programming grew during the COVID pandemic crisis when the country was under lockdown. I downloaded an application called MIMO and started practicing coding. The interest grew over time and i decided to take a step further and apply to learn from the best programming school in town- Moringa School. I enjoy taking long walks, watching sunsets, reading interesting writings and going on adventures. Currently, i am also improving my gardening skills at home with trying to plant different flowers.</p>
